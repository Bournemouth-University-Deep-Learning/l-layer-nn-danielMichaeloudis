In this exercise, you will make a L layer neural network for binary classification to classify cat and not cat images. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks to build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want. In the second lab exercise, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. The neural network algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy!\n","\n","By completing this assignment you will:\n","\n","- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a deep neural network.\n","\n","- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a deep neural network.\n","\n","- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.\n","\n","**You will learn to:**\n","- This assignment will help you in building the general architecture of your deep neural network with n hidden layer and steps include:\n","    - Initializing parameters\n","    - Forward Propagation\n","    - Backward Propagation\n","    - Gradient descent \n","- Collect all the above functions into a single function in the correct order and this function will act as a main model.\n","- you will use these functions to build a deep neural network for binary image classification.\n","\n","**After this assignment you will be able to:**\n","- Use different activation functions like ReLU to improve your model\n","- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)\n","- Implement an easy-to-use neural network \n","\n","### Recommended Reading\n","\n","-   [Chapter 3](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-3) of \"Deep Learning with Python\" by F.
